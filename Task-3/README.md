# 🎬 Task 3 - Movie Rating Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting movie ratings using Machine Learning techniques. 
The goal is to build a regression model that can estimate the rating of a movie based on various features.

## 🎯 Objective
- Perform data preprocessing and cleaning
- Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Identify important features affecting movie ratings
- Build and evaluate regression models

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset includes movie-related features such as:
- Genre
- Director
- Cast
- Budget
- Revenue
- Duration
- Year of release
- User votes

These features are used to predict the movie rating.

## 🔍 Steps Performed
- Loaded dataset using Pandas
- Handled missing values
- Converted categorical variables using encoding
- Performed data visualization
- Split dataset into training and testing sets
- Applied regression algorithms
- Evaluated model performance

## 🤖 Machine Learning Algorithms Used
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- Decision Tree Regressor

## 📈 Model Evaluation
The model performance was evaluated using:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R² Score

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 Outcome
Successfully developed a regression model capable of predicting movie ratings based on input features.
