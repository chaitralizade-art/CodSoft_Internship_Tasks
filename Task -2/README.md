# 🌸 Task 2 - Iris Flower Classification

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a Machine Learning model to classify iris flowers into different species based on their features.

The dataset contains measurements of iris flowers such as:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

Using these features, the model predicts the species of the flower.

## 🎯 Objective
- Perform data preprocessing
- Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize feature relationships
- Train and evaluate classification models

## 📊 Dataset Information
The dataset contains 150 records of iris flowers belonging to three species:
- Iris-setosa
- Iris-versicolor
- Iris-virginica

## 🔍 Steps Performed
- Loaded dataset using Pandas
- Checked for missing values
- Performed data visualization
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Applied classification algorithms
- Evaluated model performance

## 🤖 Machine Learning Algorithms Used
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree Classifier

## 📈 Model Performance
The trained model achieved high accuracy in predicting the species of iris flowers.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 Outcome
Successfully built a classification model capable of accurately predicting iris flower species based on input features.
